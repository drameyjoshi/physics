\chapter{The Electromagnetic Field Equations}\label{c4}
\begin{enumerate}
\item From equations \eqref{c3e19} and \eqref{c3e20} it follows that
\begin{eqnarray}
\curl\vec{E} &=& -\frac{1}{c}\pdt{\vec{H}}{t} \label{c4e1} \\
\dive\vec{H} &=& 0 \label{c4e2}
\end{eqnarray}
These equations can be easily cast in integral form as 
\begin{eqnarray}
\oint\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{l} &=& -\frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\int\vec{H}\cdot d\vec{f} \label{c4e3} \\
\oint\vec{H}\cdot d\vec{f} &=& 0 \label{c4e4}
\end{eqnarray}
Note that, in equation \eqref{c4e3}, the surface integral on the rhs is over the
surface bounded by the countour along which the line integral of lhs is calculated.
The line integral is over a closed curve but the surface integral is not over a 
closed surface. The equation states that the circulation of the electric field
is equal to $-1/c$ times the flux of $\vec{H}$ through the surface bound by the
countour. On the other hand, \eqref{c4e4} tells that flux of $\vec{H}$ through
any closed surface is zero.

\item Equations \eqref{c4e1} and \eqref{c4e2} form the first pair of Maxwell
equations. They do not describe the electromagnetic field completely because
they involve the time derivative of $\vec{H}$ alone and not $\vec{E}$.

\item It is possible to write equations \eqref{c4e1} and \eqref{c4e2} in terms
of the electromagnetic field tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$. Since
\[
F_{\mu\nu} = \pdt{A_\nu}{x^\mu} - \pdt{A_\mu}{x^\nu},
\]
we have
\begin{eqnarray*}
\pdt{F_{\mu\nu}}{x^\rho} &=& \pdt{A^2_\nu}{x^\mu x^\rho} - \pdt{A^2_\mu}{x^\nu x^\rho} \\
\pdt{F_{\nu\rho}}{x^\mu} &=& \pdt{A^2_\rho}{x^\nu x^\mu} - \pdt{A^2_\nu}{x^\rho x^\mu} \\
\pdt{F_{\rho\mu}}{x^\nu} &=& \pdt{A^2_\mu}{x^\rho x^\nu} - \pdt{A^2_\rho}{x^\mu x^\nu}
\end{eqnarray*}
from which we get
\begin{equation}\label{c4e5}
\pdt{F_{\mu\nu}}{x^\rho} + \pdt{F_{\nu\rho}}{x^\mu} + \pdt{F_{\rho\mu}}{x^\nu} = 0.
\end{equation}

\item We will examine \eqref{c4e5} in greater details.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\mu = 0, \nu = 1, \rho = 2$:
\[
\pdt{F_{01}}{x^2} + \pdt{F_{12}}{x^0} + \pdt{F_{20}}{x^1} = 0 \Rightarrow
\pdt{E_y}{x} - \pdt{E_x}{y} = - \frac{1}{c}\pdt{H_z}{t}.
\]

\item $\mu = 0, \nu = 1, \rho = 3$:
\[
\pdt{F_{01}}{x^3} + \pdt{F_{13}}{x^0} + \pdt{F_{30}}{x^1} = 0 \Rightarrow
\pdt{E_x}{z} - \pdt{E_z}{x} = - \frac{1}{c}\pdt{H_y}{t}.
\]

\item $\mu = 0, \nu = 2, \rho = 3$:
\[
\pdt{F_{02}}{x^3} + \pdt{F_{23}}{x^0} + \pdt{F_{30}}{x^2} = 0 \Rightarrow
\pdt{E_z}{y} - \pdt{E_y}{z} = - \frac{1}{c}\pdt{H_x}{t}.
\]

\item $\mu = 1, \nu = 2, \rho = 3$:
\[
\pdt{F_{12}}{x^3} + \pdt{F_{23}}{x^1} + \pdt{F_{31}}{x^2} = 0 \Rightarrow
-\pdt{H_z}{z} - \pdt{H_x}{x} - \pdt{H_y}{y} = 0.
\]
\end{enumerate}
Thus, \eqref{c4e5} encodes the two Maxwell equations \eqref{c4e1} and \eqref{c4e2}.
We also note that
\begin{enumerate}
\item If any two indices in \eqref{c4e5} are equal then we get the identity $0=0$.
\item If all three indices are equal then each term on lhs of \eqref{c4e5} is
zero.
\item Let us examine what happens when we consider other combinations of indices.
If we swap the values of $\mu$ and $\nu$ in case (a), that is, if $\mu = 1, \nu = 0,
\rho = 2$ then we have
\[
\pdt{F_{10}}{x^2} + \pdt{F_{02}}{x^1} + \pdt{F_{21}}{x^0} = 0 \Rightarrow
-\pdt{E_x}{y} + \pdt{E_y}{x} - \frac{1}{c}\pdt{H_z}{t} = 0,
\]
which is same as the conclusion of case (a). We can similarly show that all swaps
give 
\[
\curl\vec{E} = -\frac{1}{c}\pdt{\vec{H}}{t}.
\]
\end{enumerate}

\item Now consider the expression,
\begin{equation}\label{c4e6}
C^\mu = \epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\pdt{F_{\rho\sigma}}{x^\nu}.
\end{equation}
Then
\[
C^0 = \pdt{F_{23}}{x^1} - \pdt{F_{32}}{x^1} - \pdt{F_{13}}{x^2} + \pdt{F_{31}}{x^2}
 + \pdt{F_{12}}{x^3} - \pdt{F_{21}}{x^3}
\]
which, owing to anti-symmetric nature of $F_{\mu\nu}$ is
\[
C^0 = 2\left(\pdt{F_{23}}{x^1} + \pdt{F^{31}}{x^2} + \pdt{F_{12}}{x^3}\right)
\]
From equation \eqref{c4e5}, it is $C^0 = 0$. Similarly we can show that the other
components too vanish. Therefore, equation \eqref{c4e5} is equivalent to
\begin{equation}\label{c4e7}
\epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\pdt{F_{\rho\sigma}}{x^\nu} = 0.
\end{equation}

\item We next develop the action function for a system consisting of particles
in an electromagnetic field. From equations \eqref{c2e3} and \eqref{c2e6}, the
action for a free particle is
\begin{equation}\label{c4e8}
S_m = -mc\int ds.
\end{equation}
If there are many particles, we can write it as
\begin{equation}\label{c4e9}
S_m = -\sum_i m_ic\int ds.
\end{equation}
The subscript `m' indicates that the action depends only of the mass of the 
particles and therefore pertains to free particles alone. When the particles
interact with the field, we need an additional term,
\begin{equation}\label{c4e10}
S_{mf} = -\sum_i \frac{e_i}{c}\int A_\mu dx^\mu.
\end{equation}
It is a mild generalisation of the second term on the rhs of \eqref{c3e2}.
We need a term $S_f$ that determines the behaviour of the fields in absence of
matter so that the action of the system is
\begin{equation}\label{c4e11}
S = S_m + S_{mf} + S_f.
\end{equation}

It is an experimental fact that the electromagnetic fields obey the principle of
superposition. Therefore, the differential equations describing them must be linear.
Since the equations are derived from the variational principle, we require that the
integrand of the action integral must be quadratic in the field tensor. Furthermore,
we require the action integral to be a scalar. Therefore, we also require the 
integrand to be a scalar. The only scalar, quadratic quantity that depends on the
field tensor alone is $F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$. We propose that
\begin{equation}\label{c4e12}
S_f = a\int F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu} d\Omega.
\end{equation}

The quantity $\epsilon^{\mu\rho\nu\sigma}F^{\mu\rho}F^{\nu\sigma}$ is not 
considered to be part of $S_f$ because it is a pseudo-scalar. We showed in 
\eqref{c3e98} that it is $\vec{E}\cdot\vec{H}$. Since $\vec{H}$ is an axial vector,
the dot product is a pseudo-scalar.

Equation \eqref{c3e97} gave us
\begin{equation}\label{c4e13}
F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu} = 2(H^2 - E^2).
\end{equation}
In terms of the potentials,
\begin{equation}\label{c4e14}
F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu} = |\curl\vec{A}|^2 - |\grad\varphi|^2 + 
2\grad\varphi\pdt{\vec{A}}{t} - \left|\pdt{\vec{A}}{t}\right|^2.
\end{equation}
This shows that $F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$ can be made arbitrarily negative if $\vec{A}$
can be made to vary arbitrarily quickly with $t$. In that case, we cannot minimise
the action integral of \eqref{c4e12}. To prevent that from happening, we require
the constant $a$ to be negative. Its value depends on our choice of units. In
gaussian units, it is 
\[
a = -\frac{1}{16\pi c}
\]
so that the action for the field is
\begin{equation}\label{c4e15}
S_f = -\frac{1}{16\pi c}\int F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu} d\Omega.
\end{equation}
Using \eqref{c4e13},
\begin{equation}\label{c4e16}
S_f = \frac{1}{8\pi}\int (E^2 - H^2) dt dV,
\end{equation}
where we used the fact that $d\Omega = cdtdV$. We can also write it as
\begin{equation}\label{c4e17}
S_f = \int dt \left(\frac{1}{8\pi}\int dV (E^2 - H^2)\right) = \int dt L,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}\label{c4e18}
L_f = \frac{1}{8\pi}\int dV (E^2 - H^2) = \int dV \mathcal{L}_f.
\end{equation}
The quantity,
\begin{equation}\label{c4e19}
\mathcal{L}_f = \frac{1}{8\pi}(E^2 - H^2)
\end{equation}
is called the Lagrangian density of the field and $L_f$ the Lagrangian of the 
field.

\item It is convenient to introduce charge density and treat discrete charges in
terms of it. For example,
\begin{equation}\label{c4e20}
\rho = \sum_a e_a\delta(\vec{r} - \vec{r}_a)
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{c4e21}
de = \rho dV.
\end{equation}
From equation \eqref{c4e21} we have
\begin{equation}\label{c4e22}
de dx^\mu = \rho dV dx^\mu = \rho dV dt \td{x^\mu}{t}.
\end{equation}
We call the quantity,
\begin{equation}\label{c4e23}
j^\mu = \rho\td{x^\mu}{t}
\end{equation}
as the \emph{current density}. Clearly, as 
\[
\td{x^\mu}{t} = (c, \vec{v})
\]
we have
\begin{equation}\label{c4e24}
j^\mu = (\rho c, \rho\vec{v}) = (\rho c, \vec{j})
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}\label{c4e25}
\vec{j} = \rho\vec{v}
\end{equation}
is the usual current density 3-vector.

\item This is a bit tricky. Consider the surface integral,
\[
\int j^\mu dS_\mu.
\]
If the surface its normal along the $x^0$ axis then $j^\mu dS_\mu = j^0 dV$ and
\[
\int j^\mu dS_\mu = \int j^0 dV = c\int \rho dV = ce,
\]
where $e$ is the total charge enclosed by the hypersurface. From this equation
we can write
\begin{equation}\label{c4e26}
\int\rho dV = \frac{1}{c}\int j^\mu dS_\mu,
\end{equation}
where the surface integral is over a hypersurface whose normal is along the $x^0$
axis. For an arbitrary hypersurface,
\[
\frac{1}{c}\int j^\mu dS_\mu
\]
is just the sum of charges whose world lines pass through it.

\item From equations \eqref{c4e9}, \eqref{c4e10}, \eqref{c4e11} and \eqref{c4e15},
the action of the system of charged particles in electromagnetic fields is
\[
S = -\sum_i m_ic\int ds - \sum_i\frac{e_i}{c}\int A_\mu dx^\mu - \frac{1}{16\pi c}
\int F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu} d\Omega.
\]
The second term is
\[
S_{mf} = -\frac{1}{c}\sum_i e_i\left(\int A_0dx^0 + \cdot + \int A_3dx^3\right).
\]
For a continuous charge distribution, we replace $\sum_i e_i$ by $\int \rho dV$
so that
\begin{eqnarray*}
S_{mf} &=& -\frac{1}{c}\int dV \rho\left(\int A_0dx^0 + \cdots + \int A_3dx^3\right) \\
 &=& -\frac{1}{c}\left(\int dVdt \rho\td{x^0}{t}A_0 + \cdots + \int dVdt \rho\td{x^3}{t}A_3\right) \\
 &=& -\frac{1}{c}\left(\int dVdt j^0A_0 + \cdots + \int dVdt j^3A_3\right)
\end{eqnarray*}
where we used equation \eqref{c4e23} in the last equation. Finally, we write it
as
\begin{equation}\label{c4e27}
S_{mf} = -\frac{1}{c^2}\int j^\mu A_\mu d\Omega.
\end{equation}
Thus, the action can be written as
\begin{equation}\label{c4e28}
S = -\sum_i m_ic\int ds - \frac{1}{c^2}\int j^\mu A_\mu d\Omega - 
\frac{1}{16\pi c}\int F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu} d\Omega.
\end{equation}

\item It is an experimental fact that electric charge is conserved. It is expressed
as an equation of continuity,
\begin{equation}\label{c4e29}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\int\rho dV = -\oint \rho\vec{v}\cdot d\vec{f}.
\end{equation}
The left hand side, if it is positive, is the rate of increase of charge per unit
time in the region of integration. The right hand side is the rate of inflow of
charges in the region of integration. The negative sign is needed because $d\vec{f}$
always points outwards so that if $\vec{v}$ points inwards then the dot product 
is negative. To get an overall positive sign, we negate the surface integral.
In differential form, \eqref{c4e29} is
\begin{equation}\label{c4e30}
\pdt{\rho}{t} + \dive\vec{j} = 0.
\end{equation}
We can also write it as
\[
\pdt{\rho}{t} + \pdt{j^1}{x^1} + \pdt{j^2}{x^2} + \pdt{j^3}{x^3} = 0.
\]
Since $j^\mu = (c\rho, \vec{j})$, this equation is equivalent to
\begin{equation}\label{c4e31}
\pdt{j^\mu}{x^\mu} = 0.
\end{equation}
This is the four-dimensional form of the equation of continuity.

\item Recall equation \eqref{c4e26} in which
\[
\frac{1}{c}\int j^\mu dS_\mu
\]
is the total charge at a time $x^0/c$ and the integral is over a hypersurface 
normal to the $x^0$ axis at that time. Consider the integral
\[
\frac{1}{c}\oint j^\mu dS_\mu,
\]
where the closed surface consists of the hypersurface of instant of time, a
similar hypersurface at a later instant of time and thw two joined by surface
parallel to $x^0$ axis far away from the charge distribution. The integral over
this latter surface is zero because $j^\mu$ is zero on it. Therefore,
\begin{equation}\label{c4e32}
\frac{1}{c}\oint j^\mu dS_\mu = 0.
\end{equation}
Using the divergence theorem, we can transform the surface integral to a volume
integral so that
\[
\frac{1}{c}\int \pdt{j^\mu}{x^\mu} = 0.
\]
Since this is true for any two points on the $x^0$ axis, the divergence itself
is zero. This is another way of proving \eqref{c4e31}.

\item We showed in chapter \ref{c3} that the transformation described by equation
\eqref{c3e30},
\[
A_\mu^\op = A_\mu - \pdt{f}{x^\mu},
\]
also called the gauge transformation, leaves the fields unchanged. Let us make 
this transformation in the second term, \eqref{c4e27}, of the action \eqref{c4e28}.
Then,
\[
S_{mf} \rightarrow -\frac{1}{c^2}\int j^\mu A_\mu d\Omega + \frac{1}{c^2}
\int j^\mu\pdt{f}{x^\mu} d\Omega.
\]
Now,
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\mu}(fj^\mu) = f\pdt{j^\mu}{x^\mu} + j^\mu\pdt{f}{x^\mu}.
\]
If the equation of continuity, \eqref{c4e31}, is valid then
\begin{equation}\label{c4e33}
\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\mu}(fj^\mu) = j^\mu\pdt{f}{x^\mu}
\end{equation}
and
\[
S_{mf} \rightarrow -\frac{1}{c^2}\int j^\mu A_\mu d\Omega + \frac{1}{c^2}
\int \frac{\partial}{\partial x^\mu}(fj^\mu) d\Omega.
\]
Using divergence theorem on the second term,
\[
S_{mf} \rightarrow -\frac{1}{c^2}\int j^\mu A_\mu d\Omega + \frac{1}{c^2}
\int (fj^\mu) dS_\mu.
\]
We can always choose the surface to be large enough that $j^\mu$ is zero on it,
in which case, the integral vanishes. This manipulation critically depends on the
validity of \eqref{c4e33}, which in turn depends on the equation of continuity.
This shows that the gauge invariance of the electromagnetic fields is closely
related to the equation of continuity, in other words, to conservation of 
electric charge. Electric charge must be conserved if gauge invariance must be
true.

\item In finding the equations of motion from variational principle we assumed
that the fields are fixed while varying the generalised coordinates. Now, we will
assume that the generalised coordinates are fixed and will vary the fields instead.
The resulting equations are the second pair of Maxwell equations. The expression
for total action in \eqref{c4e28} has fields only in the second and the third
terms. Therefore,
\begin{equation}\label{c4e34}
\delta S = -\frac{1}{c^2}\int j^\mu \delta A_\mu d\Omega - \frac{1}{16\pi c}
\int\delta(F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu})d\Omega.
\end{equation}
Now 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\delta(F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}) &=& (\delta F_{\mu\nu})F^{\mu\nu} + F_{\mu\nu} (\delta F^{\mu\nu}) \\
 &=& 2F^{\mu\nu}\delta F_{\mu\nu} \\
 &=& 2F^{\mu\nu}\left(\pdt{\delta A_\nu}{x^\mu} - \pdt{\delta A_\mu}{x^\nu}\right) \\
 &=& 2F^{\mu\nu}\pdt{\delta A_\nu}{x^\mu} - 2F^{\mu\nu}\pdt{\delta A_\mu}{x^\nu} \\
 &=& 2F^{\nu\mu}\pdt{\delta A_\mu}{x^\nu} - 2F^{\mu\nu}\pdt{\delta A_\mu}{x^\nu} \\
 &=& -2F^{\mu\nu}\pdt{\delta A_\mu}{x^\nu} - 2F^{\mu\nu}\pdt{\delta A_\mu}{x^\nu} \\
 &=& -4F^{\mu\nu}\pdt{\delta A_\mu}{x^\nu}
\end{eqnarray*}
so that equation \eqref{c4e34} becomes
\begin{equation}\label{c4e35}
\delta S = -\frac{1}{c^2}\int j^\mu \delta A_\mu d\Omega + \frac{1}{4\pi c}
\int F^{\mu\nu}\pdt{\delta A_\mu}{x^\nu} d\Omega
\end{equation}
Since 
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\nu}(F^{\mu\nu} \delta A_\mu) =
F^{\mu\nu}\pdt{\delta A_\mu}{x^\nu} + \delta A_\mu\pdt{F^{\mu\nu}}{x^\nu},
\]
\begin{eqnarray}
\delta S &=& -\frac{1}{c^2}\int j^\mu \delta A_\mu d\Omega + 
\frac{1}{4\pi c}\int \frac{\partial}{\partial x^\nu}(F^{\mu\nu} \delta A_\mu) d\Omega - \nonumber \\
 & & \frac{1}{4\pi c}\int \delta A_\mu\pdt{F^{\mu\nu}}{x^\nu} d\Omega \nonumber \\
 &=& -\frac{1}{c}\left(\frac{1}{c}\int j^\mu \delta A_\mu d\Omega + 
    \frac{1}{4\pi} \int\delta A_\mu\pdt{F^{\mu\nu}}{x^\nu}d\Omega\right) + \nonumber \\
 & & \frac{1}{4\pi c}\int F^{\mu\nu}\delta A_\mu dS_\mu, \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
where we used the generalisation of Gauss' theorem to 4-dimensions to convert a
volume integral to a surface integral. We can always choose the surface to be so
large that there are no fields on it. As a result the last term can be ignored
and we are left with
\begin{equation}\label{c4e36}
\delta S = -\frac{1}{c}\int\left(\frac{j^\mu}{c} +
 \frac{1}{4\pi}\pdt{F^{\mu\nu}}{x^\nu}\right)\delta A_\mu d\Omega
\end{equation}
If $\delta S = 0$ for arbitrary variations of the fields then we must have
\begin{equation}\label{c4e37}
\pdt{F^{\mu\nu}}{x^\nu} = -\frac{4\pi}{c}j^\mu.
\end{equation}
This equation includes the remaining two Maxwell equations. For $\mu=0$, it is
\[
\pdt{F^{00}}{x^0} + \pdt{F^{01}}{x^1} + \pdt{F^{02}}{x^2} + \pdt{F^{03}}{x^3}
= -\frac{4\pi}{c}j^0 = -4\pi\rho.
\]
From \eqref{c3e77}, $F^{01} = -E_1, F^{02} = -E_2, F^{03} = -E_3$ so that the
above equation is
\begin{equation}\label{c4e38}
\dive\vec{E} = 4\pi\rho.
\end{equation}
For $\mu = 1$, \eqref{c4e37} becomes,
\[
\pdt{F^{10}}{x^0} + \pdt{F^{11}}{x^1} + \pdt{F^{12}}{x^2} + \pdt{F^{13}}{x^3}
= -\frac{4\pi}{c}j^1 = -\frac{4\pi}{c}j^1
\]
that is,
\[
\frac{1}{c}\pdt{E_1}{t} + 0 - \pdt{H_3}{x_2} + \pdt{H_2}{x_3} = -\frac{4\pi}{c}j^1
\]
or
\begin{equation}\label{c4e39}
(\curl\vec{H})_x = \frac{4\pi}{c}j_x + \frac{1}{c}\pdt{E_x}{t}.
\end{equation}
The other components can be derived similarly. We thus get,
\begin{equation}\label{c4e40}
\curl\vec{H} = \frac{4\pi}{c}\vec{j} + \frac{1}{c}\pdt{\vec{E}}{t}.
\end{equation}
Equations \eqref{c4e1}, \eqref{c4e2}, \eqref{c4e38} and \eqref{c4e40}, are the
four Maxwell equations. In terms of field vectors they are
\begin{eqnarray*}
\curl\vec{E} &=& -\frac{1}{c}\pdt{\vec{H}}{t} \\
\dive\vec{H} &=& 0 \\
\dive\vec{E} &=& 4\pi\rho \\
\curl\vec{H} &=& \frac{4\pi}{c}\vec{j} + \frac{1}{c}\pdt{\vec{E}}{t}.
\end{eqnarray*}
They can be equivalently written in terms of the electromagnetic field tensor as
equations \eqref{c4e5} and \eqref{c4e37}.
\begin{eqnarray*}
\pdt{F_{\mu\nu}}{x^\rho} + \pdt{F_{\nu\rho}}{x^\mu} + \pdt{F_{\rho\mu}}{x^\nu} &=& 0 \\
\pdt{F^{\mu\nu}}{x^\nu} &=& -\frac{4\pi}{c}j^\mu
\end{eqnarray*}

\item Equation \eqref{c4e38} in integral form is
\begin{equation}\label{c4e41}
\oint\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{f} = 4\pi\int\rho dV.
\end{equation}
The total electric flux over a closed surface is equal to $4\pi$ times the total 
charge enclosed in it. This is \emph{Gauss law}.

\item Equation \eqref{c4e40} in integral form is
\begin{equation}\label{c4e42}
\oint\vec{H}\cdot d\vec{l} = \frac{4\pi}{c}\left(\int\vec{j}\cdot d\vec{f} + 
\frac{1}{4\pi}\int\pdt{\vec{E}}{t}\cdot d\vec{f}\right).
\end{equation}
The first term in the bracket on the rhs is the true current while the second one
is called the `displacement current'. The term,
\[
\frac{1}{4\pi}\pdt{\vec{E}}{t}
\]
is called the \emph{displacement current density}.

\item From \eqref{c4e40}, one immediately gets, after taking divergence of both sides
and using \eqref{c4e38},
\[
\dive\vec{j} + \pdt{\rho}{t} = 0.
\]
Thus the equation of continuity and charge conversation are encoded in 
\eqref{c4e37}. It can also be easily derived taking the derivative of \eqref{c4e37}
with respect to $x^\mu$,
\[
\frac{\partial^2 F^{\mu\nu}}{\partial x^\mu \partial x^\nu} = -\frac{4\pi}{c}\pdt{j^\mu}{x^\mu}.
\]
The lhs can be written as
\[
\frac{\partial^2 F^{\mu\nu}}{\partial x^\mu \partial x^\nu} = 
\frac{\partial^2 F^{\nu\mu}}{\partial x^\nu \partial x^\mu}
= -\frac{\partial^2 F^{\mu\nu}}{\partial x^\nu \partial x^\mu} = 
-\frac{\partial^2 F^{\mu\nu}}{\partial x^\mu \partial x^\nu}.
\]
The last step follows from the equality of mixed partial derivatives and the 
second last from the anti-symmetry of $F^{\mu\nu}$. Thus the lhs has to be zero
so that, we have,
\[
\pdt{j^\mu}{x^\mu} = 0,
\]
which is indeed the equation of continuity, \eqref{c4e31}, in 4-vector form.

\item Taking dot product of \eqref{c4e1} with $\vec{H}$ and that of \eqref{c4e40}
with $\vec{E}$, we get
\begin{eqnarray*}
\vec{H}\cdot\curl\vec{E} &=& -\frac{1}{2c}\pdt{H^2}{t} \\
\vec{E}\cdot\curl\vec{H} &=& \frac{4\pi}{c}\vec{j}\cdot\vec{E} + \frac{1}{2c}\pdt{E^2}{t}
\end{eqnarray*}
Subtracting the first equation from the second,
\begin{equation}\label{c4e43}
\vec{E}\cdot\curl\vec{H} - \vec{H}\cdot\curl\vec{E} = \frac{4\pi}{c}\vec{j}\cdot\vec{E}
+ \frac{1}{2c}\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(E^2 + H^2).
\end{equation}
We can rearrange it as
\begin{equation}\label{c4e44}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{E^2 + H^2}{8\pi}\right) = 
-\vec{j}\cdot\vec{E} - 
\frac{\vec{H}\cdot\curl\vec{E} - \vec{E}\cdot\curl\vec{H}}{4\pi c}.
\end{equation}
The \emph{Poynting vector}, is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{c4e45}
\vec{S} = \frac{\vec{E} \times \vec{H}}{4\pi c}
\end{equation}
so that \eqref{c4e44} can be written as
\begin{equation}\label{c4e46}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{E^2 + H^2}{8\pi}\right) = 
-\vec{j}\cdot\vec{E} - \dive\vec{S}.
\end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
