These exercises were taken from Professor Thanu Padmanabhan's course on general
relativity.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Construct a Lagrangian
\[
L(\partial_a\varphi, \varphi) = \frac{1}{2}\partial_a\varphi\partial^a\varphi
\]
and show that the Euler-Lagrange equation is $\Box\varphi = 0$. 

\item Consider the Lagrangian
\[
L = \frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu A_\nu \partial^\mu A^\nu) + 4\pi J_\mu A^\mu
\]
and show that the Euler-Lagrange equation is $\Box A^\mu = 4\pi J^\mu$. Could
this be an appropriate Lagrangian for the electromagnetic field?
Hint: Construct the Hamiltonian and show that it can have arbitrary negative 
values.

\item In the Lagrangian of problem 1, introduct a source term and show that
like charges attract.

Problems 1 to 3 are taken from \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhgk6sMWGfM&list=PLfrsXbPUIUSB6xoXyIvVEHYiG-hVmJhHf&index=6}{lecture 6} 
of the course. The topics are discussed between 15 and 20 minutes.
\end{enumerate}
