\frametitle{Maxwell's theory}
\begin{itemize}
\item In the mid-nineteenth century, Maxwell unified the separate branches of
electricity and magnetism into a single electromagnetic theory. A consequence
of it was the existence of electromagnetic waves which could travel at the
speed of $3 \times 10^8$ ms${}^{-1}$ in vacuum. Hertz demonstrated the 
existence of these waves in 1884.
\item Physicists did not accept the idea of waves travelling in vacuum. After 
all, the undulations of a wave must be of some material. Therefore, they 
proposed the existence of a substance called aether. It was supposed to have
zero density and perfect transparency.
\item Recall from previous lecture that Newton's laws had the same mathematical
form in all inertial frames of reference. However, this quality was found to
be lacking in Maxwell's equation and the equation of electromagnetic waves.
\item This means that one can use electromagnetic phenomena to detect uniform
motion. Michelson and Morley designed an ingenious experiment to measure earth's
speed around the sun.
